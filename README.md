# Araceli's biography

My name is Araceli Garcia and I am originally from Barcelona, Spain, but currently living in the Cayman Islands. 

When I finished high school I started studying English and German Translation and Interpreting at university, however during my third year I realized that I didn't see myself working as a translator or interpreter and I decided to study something different. 

After one sabbatical year trying to figure out what I would like to study, I started a Bachelor Degree in Tourism and Hotel Management, which I finished in 2018, which is when I moved to the Cayman Islands to work at the [Kimpton Seafire Resort & Sp](https://www.seafireresortandspa.com/) a -a gorgeous, gorgeous hotel in the Caribbean.

When COVID-19 hit in 2020 and the tourism industry suffered a major setback I started doing market reasearch to find new career paths and opportunities. By then I was about to turn 30 years old and after having been able to sustain myself since 20 years old, feeling like all of that could change and I would have to go back to my parents' place, amongst others, was very scary. So I decided to learn a new skill and develop myself. 

By 2022 I got offered a job at [Cayman Enterprise City](https://www.caymanenterprisecity.com/) as a project coordinator. Position I still hold. CEC is a company that operates in the Special Economic Zone and hosts over 300 companies from all around the world, most of these companies being tech.
